    ## tributing sub-battlefield. If two battlefields share the same sub-battlefield as the second(third)
    ## most contributing then split the resources proportionally to how much they contribute similar
    ## to 1. If all three share the same second(third) contributing sub-battlefield, distribute the ac-
    ## cording the the contribution of the battlefield. If one battlefield shares a second contributing
    ## sub-battlefield with a third contributing sub-battlefield in a different sub-battle field, then all
    ## the resources go to the battlefield that has the second contributing sub-battlefield

    ## chosen to be second and one third and proceedure it carried out same as above

    ## cannot be used. If the most contributing subbattlefield and the second are identical, then this stragegy 
    ## cannot be used

    ## other

    ## contribution gets the larger percentage and the second most contribution get the smaller percentage 
    ## while the least contributing gets 0
    ##If one battlefields have identical second and third most contributing subbattlefields, then one is 
    ## chosen to be second and one third and proceedure it carried out same as above
